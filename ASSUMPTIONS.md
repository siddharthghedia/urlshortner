##ASSUMPTIONS

Following are the Assumptions that I have made:
- Privacy-aware URLs are private and won't be displayed on public list
- For now, we just need the stats for clicks and clicks will be the number of actual clicks done by the user, IP checking and other checkings are not included in this version.
